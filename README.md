# ‚òÅÔ∏è CloudLaunch AWS Deployment README üíª

### This project details the deployment of a lightweight, secure product named **CloudLaunch** on AWS. The solution leverages core services like **S3** for static website hosting and file storage, **IAM** for robust access control, and **VPC** for a secure network foundation.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Task 1: Static Website Hosting & IAM Setup

### **Description of Steps**

1. **S3 Buckets:** Three S3 buckets were created:
    - `cloudlaunch-sitepub-michaelaworetan`: Configured for static website hosting with a public read-only bucket policy.
    - `cloudlaunch-siteprivate-michaelaworetan`: Created to store internal private documents. Public access was blocked.
    - `cloudlaunch-sitevol-michaelaworetan`: Created to be visible but with its contents inaccessible to the designated IAM user. Public access was blocked.
2. **Static Website:** The provided HTML, CSS, and JS files were uploaded to the `cloudlaunch-sitepub-michaelaworetan` bucket, and static website hosting was enabled in the bucket properties.
3. **IAM User & Policy:** An IAM user named `cloudlaunch-user` was created. A custom policy was attached to this user to enforce strict access controls on the S3 buckets and provide read-only access to VPC components. The policy explicitly denies `DeleteObject` permissions on all buckets.
4. **CloudFront (Bonus):** A CloudFront distribution was set up in front of the [https://dze8vneqs3jx1.cloudfront.net](dze8vneqs3jx1.cloudfront.net) to provide **HTTPS** and **global caching**, improving website security and performance.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Task 2: VPC Network Design

### **Description of Steps**

1. **VPC:** A new VPC, `cloudlaunch-vpc`, was created with a CIDR block of `10.0.0.0/16`.
2. **Subnets:** Three subnets were provisioned within the VPC:
    - `cloudlaunch-public-subnet` (`10.0.1.0/24`) for public-facing resources.
    - `cloudlaunch-app-subnet` (`10.0.2.0/24`) for private application servers.
    - `cloudlaunch-db-subnet` (`10.0.3.0/28`) for private database services.
3. **Internet Gateway:** An Internet Gateway named `cloudlaunch-igw` was created and attached to the VPC.
4. **Route Tables:**
    - `cloudlaunch-public-rt`: Configured to route internet-bound traffic (`0.0.0.0/0`) to the `cloudlaunch-igw` and associated with the public subnet.
    - `cloudlaunch-app-rt` and `cloudlaunch-db-rt`: These were left as private route tables with no route to the Internet Gateway, ensuring they are isolated from the internet.
5. **Security Groups:** Two security groups were created to control network traffic:
    - `cloudlaunch-app-sg`: Allows inbound **HTTP** (port 80) traffic only from within the VPC's CIDR block.
    - `cloudlaunch-db-sg`: Allows inbound **MySQL** (port 3306) traffic only from the `cloudlaunch-app-sg`.
